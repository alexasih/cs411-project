As a logged in user, I want to search for specific cuisine/restaurant for when I donâ€™t want to cook. I want to use the search bar to look up a dish/cuisine/restaurant so I can find out where I will be eating that night. I hope to go somewhere either within walking distance or a short drive away. I want to be asked for permission to use my current location and then use Google Maps to open recommendations. Additionally, nearby restaurants will be searched with Spoon API.
