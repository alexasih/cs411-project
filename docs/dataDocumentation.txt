We are using MongoDB, a document-based data store.

Commented JSON schema:
-format and expected values of each field
-which fields are required
-note on which fields to use for keys for each schema
-cache information

IN RECIPEDATA (all the following fields are required):
{
    recipeID: this is the specific recipe ID given by spoonacular to access this recipe, **KEY FOR SCHEMA**
    recipeTitle: recipe title,
    recipeImage: url link to image of recipe,
    "missedIngredients": this stores all the information regarding each ingredient that we are not looking up but still need for the recipe

Cache information for recipedata:
In project.js, we use the cache to check and see if we already have looked up and saved a particular recipe. If so, we do not need to call the API again
which wastes time, and instead we just look it up in the database, recipedata. If it is found, then we can look up the information and continue. Otherwise, we
must insert a new recipe into the database.
